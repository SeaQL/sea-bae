# `sea-bae`

`sea-bae` is a crate for proc macro authors, which simplifies parsing of attributes. It is forked from [davidpdrsn/bae](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/bae), which is inspired by [`darling`](https://crates.io/crates/darling) but has a simpler API.

This fork upgrades `syn` to `2.0` and `heck` to `0.4`, mainly for use in `sea-orm`.

See [the docs](https://docs.rs/sea-bae) for more info.
